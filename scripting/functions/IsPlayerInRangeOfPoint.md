|Float:x | The X coordinate of the point to check the range to.|
|Float:y | The Y coordinate of the point to check the range to.|
|Float:z | The Z coordinate of the point to check the range to.|


## Returns

 true - The player is in range of the point.

 false - The player is not in range of the point.



## Examples


```c
if (!strcmp("/stadium", cmdtext))
{
    if (IsPlayerInRangeOfPoint(playerid, 7.0, 2695.6880, -1704.6300, 11.8438))
